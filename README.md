## Project Files Overview

### Biggs_Data Folder
This directory contains the tabulated Hartree-Fock data for the theoretical Compton profiles.

### Convol_new.m Code
Contained within this section is the MATLAB code, "Convol_new.m," which we utilized for convoluting the theoretical data to align with experimental resolution.

### POSCAR_LNO File
The file named "POSCAR_LNO" corresponds to the POSCAR configuration used in the VASP DFT calculations for the LiNiO2 cathode material.

### POSCAR_WLNO File
Similarly, the "POSCAR_WLNO" file corresponds to the POSCAR configuration used in the VASP DFT calculations for the W-doped LiNiO2 cathode material.

### Experimental_ComptonProfiles.xlsx
This Excel file, "Experimental_ComptonProfiles.xlsx," contains the experimental Compton data for both W-doped LiNiO2 and undoped LiNiO2.
